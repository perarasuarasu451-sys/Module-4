## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
a=eval(input())
b=eval(input())
c=a.copy()
c.update(b)
print(c)
```

## Output
<img width="966" height="290" alt="438927958-73844d5d-fea7-4dff-8ee5-c2483641e2c0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23ce4cf-ecdb-48e1-88f5-d6ba76556030" />

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
