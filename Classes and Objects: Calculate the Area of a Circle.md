# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the *area of a circle* based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named cse and a method mech to perform the calculation.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. *Get user input*: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. *Define the class*: Create a class named cse.
3. *Define the method*: Inside the class, define the method mech to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. *Execute the program*: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## 🧾 Program

```

import math

class cse:
    def mech(self, radius):
        # Calculate the area of the circle
        area = math.pi * radius * radius
        return area
circle = cse()
r = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = circle.mech(r)
print("Area of the circle:", area)
```
