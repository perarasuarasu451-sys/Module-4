# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file story.txt that do *not* start with the alphabet 'T'.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Open the file story.txt in *read mode*.
2. Initialize a counter count to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is *not* 'T'.
   - If the line does not start with 'T', increment the count by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the count value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with 'T'.

## 🧾 Program
```
import csv
count = 0
with open('story.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        stripped_line = line.lstrip()
        if stripped_line and not stripped_line.startswith('T'):
            count += 1
print("Number of lines not starting with 'T':", count)
```

## Result
The program successfully counts the number of lines in text file
