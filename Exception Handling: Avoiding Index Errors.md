# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that handles an *IndexError* when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list list1 with some integer elements.
2. Use a *try-except* block:
   - In the try block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., list1[5]).
   - In the except block, catch the error and print a custom message "You're out of list range".
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## 🧾 Program


```
Add code here

# Define a list
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Try to access an element out of range
try:
    print(list1[5])
except IndexError:
    print("You're out of list range")


```

## Result
The program successfully handles an IndexError when attempting to access a list element beyond its range.
Instead of crashing, it prints a custom message, informing the user that the requested index is out of range.
